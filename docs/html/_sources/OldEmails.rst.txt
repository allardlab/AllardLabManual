How to schedule a meeting
-------------------------

One of the most empowering things about being in our big, active community is that we can exploit the expertise of those around us.
But one of the most frustrating and limiting tasks is scheduling a synchronous activity with a group.
Here are some tips.

Always:

- When you send out a poll of time, always specify a reply-by date, and say explicitly that it is to "protect the calendars" or "protect your schedules" of the respondents. 
- If you need 5 members, don't pick 5 and then find a time. Make a ranked list of around 10, and start at the top. Try to find a committee that fits into the time interval. This is much easier than setting a committee then finding a time.


Sometimes:

- Do it in two stages: First to pick day, and a second to pick the time (this reduces, e.g., 5 times in 5 days =25 options to 10 options)
- Offer them to tell you their availability by e-mail, and you put it into the platform.

Rarely, but when possible:

- Wait until someone asks you a favor. Then, in the same e-mail when you respond to their request, remind them about your request.

Technology exists to help, but none of it is perfect: doodle, when2meet, Qualtrics (UCI gets it free), or a google form (most flexible).


.. _receiving_reviews:

An old e-mail about receiving peer reviews
------------------------------------------

"...it is possible we get our referee reports back ...

Even when the reviews are good, they are often worded in a way that sounds harsh. It is difficult to tell whether we should resubmit and rebut, or move to another journal, without careful thinking.

My rule is that, when I get review reports, I read them fully, then I set them aside for 24 hours for my emotions to cool before I think about next steps.

`The history of scientific progress <https://www.sciencealert.com/these-8-papers-were-rejected-before-going-on-to-win-the-nobel-prize>`_ is contained in all the papers that were, at first, rejected. The following advice I was given by my friends in high school: If you are not getting rejected some of the time, you are not aiming high enough!"



An old e-mail about accepting a conference invitation
-----------------------------------------------------

"Many times, I've made decisions to spend time with family and friends rather than scientific opportunities, and I have never ever regretted it. A few times, I've tried to juggle too many things simultaneously, and then I've sometimes regretted it -- feeling like I gave both family & science my "leftovers". I have also had events where the most valuable thing was simply showing up, to show support for family or friends, e.g., to give one specific hug, and it didn't matter whether it lasted 1 minute or 3 days. If it were me making this decision, I would think of it as speaking at the conference and giving my family my leftovers (which might be enough) versus going to the family event, and giving the conference my leftovers (in which case we can't commit to speaking)."
