Jun's paper writing tips and trick
----------------------------------



How I write papers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0. Find some role-model papers, just to get inspiration for how to arrange figures, expose statements, organize subsections. Ideally the role-model paper is from a similar journal to the one we are targeting.
   
1. Outline the story: What are the Results headings and all the subfigures that tell this story? Sketch abstract.
   
2. Subfigures in Matlab .eps files
   
3. Assemble figures, write captions. Nice meaty captions: A good paper can be followed by reading captions alone (without reading Main Text).

Now relax. Lots of work ahead, but if you did 1-3 correctly, the rest is like a ball rolling down a hill.

4. Write Results text, Methods/Model text, Supplement. A good paper can be followed by reading Results text alone (without looking at figs).
5. Big literature review, spend a few days, re-read ~15 papers, search for anything we missed.
6. Write Discussion text. Connect to the field. Rank order paragraphs from most important to least important. Be upfront, but not apologetic, about limitations of work.
7. Write Intro text. The main purpose of Intro is to describe the gap in knowledge. Writing such a short overview of the field requires you to have an opinion of the field -- mark of scientific maturity.
8. Assemble, polish. Clean up references. Give to lots of people for feedback. Get ideas for suggested referees.
9. Draft cover letter to the handling editor

 - Omer's 4 key questions to answer in a cover letter: (1) How will this work make others think differently and move the field forward? (2) How does our work relate to current literature? (3) Who is the most relevant audience for the work? (4) What has the work accomplished and what has it not achieved?

Now relax. Measured in "wall clock" time, you might be halfway. The next step requires a stomach: :ref:`receiving peer review <receiving_reviews>`.

Jun's Revision process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My workflow for resubmissions is as follows. It's kind of cumbersome but I find it works.

- I give every Reviewer comment a code, like "Rev1Minor3".

- I create THREE google docs in `a folder here <https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Fnvh7tMW2qKfAqGih7cZQu2FYQpl11KP>`_.

  - `A Big Notes doc <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zdCiVCJsp_Lre1qBHlYqLhaWmsT9mRdUEwPqgVDR06M/edit?usp=sharing>`_, with the Reviewer comments, todo lists / Action Items, paragraph drafts for the response letter, paragraph drafts for the new manuscript, and other notes.

  - `A "Dashboard" doc <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJF-WhjId5Jq-zjtKajfnrgNW0tzaovpl3gdHIQdzQA/edit?usp=sharing>`_, with very short summary of each comment, so we can check them off as we go -- like a progress dashboard.

  - Another doc for the actual `careful response letter <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ap_7f1qu0ZUwOYDTvV-qGcEqiTH_IX9LgTKLFlV54hU/edit?usp=sharing>`_. This is mostly blank for now, but then can be made quickly following cut-and-paste from Big Notes, and then edited carefully, especially for tone, which is easy to get wrong.


Writing tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* *cut cut cut cut cut*

* One paper should have one main message. Repeat main message 5 times: In Title, Abstract, Intro, Results, Discussion. (In rare cases, 2 main messages.) All other messages go in Results and Discussion

* *cut cut cut cut cut*

* Writing a paper is a continuum of fact-reporting (“we did this”, “we observed this”) to interpretation (“this suggests that…”, “this might have implications for…”). Caption is most factual, followed by Results text, followed by figure caption first sentence and Result headings. Discussion is most interpretation. For some historical reason, the figure caption's first sentence is the interpretation, while the subfigure sentences are factual.

* Whitehead said, “By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect increases the mental power of [the reader].”

* Savage and Yeh `"Novelist Cormac McCarthy's tips on how to write a great science paper <https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02918-5>`_, Nature 2019 I disagree with like half of these.

* *cut cut cut cut* part ii: "On the other hand", "It is important to note", ... are usually meaningless clutter. (There are exceptions.)
