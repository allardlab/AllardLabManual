"A user guide to Jun"
---------------------

1. How long should you stay stuck on something, trying to figure it out for yourself, before coming for help? About one week.

2. The best way to reach me is e-mail. 

3. Under normal operations, the turnaround time for e-mails is within 24hrs of "business time" (e.g. weekdays). For logistics (scheduling meetings with a collaborator, we're at a conference, we're hosting a visitor), my expectation is slightly faster or much faster. When you are on vacation, or weekends or planned time-off, it is much slower.

4. **It is more important for me to know when you're on reduced effort than that your effort be maximal.**

5. I take working with collaborators seriously.  By far the most impactful stuff we do is collaborative, but collaboration means it's not just about you. I take my role here seriously and expect you to as well. Working on a project with another lead (e.g., grad student or postdoc) changes everything, pressure is on. I take this seriously and you will also be expected to. 

6. Time is the single most important resource, both materially and symbolically. Not wasting other people's time means showing up on-time to meetings and not going over in a formal time allotment.

7. I struggle with this tension: As PI, I view it as my job to always have an idea for the **nearest publishable core** that is rigorous and worth sharing with the world; and as a scientist / scientist-in-training, you need the space to explore, wonder, experiment. I am not always successful in balancing these.

8. I struggle with this bias: A few times in my past, a project failed that I invested my whole heart. Correctly or incorrectly, I subconsiously attribute these past failures to **running out of time** (before trainees or lead researchers left or had to prioritize other objectives, ...), and over-investment in going for something more important or complete. This has led me to a bias towards forward momention, "quick and dirty" and "above threshold" planning. Deadlines (conference abstracts, manuscript submissions, grant timelines) feel to me like lifelines—opportunities to crystallize our work before it slips away into the fog of unfinished ideas. Sometimes, this means I might push for speed at the expense of chasing every fascinating side question, every extra control, or every ounce of scientific wonder. If you ever feel this pressure is undercutting the joy or depth of the work, flag it for me. I’d much rather recalibrate than lose sight of what makes science meaningful. **The downside is that it means *you* might need to be the one to keep your eye on the clock.**




..
   1. My most foundational belief is this: Different people have different goals. We should celebrate and exploit this heterogeneity. We should try to maximize everyone's happiness in their own definition. Almost always, this means the following: if something is win-win, win-neutral, or neutral-win, we do it, and if it is anything else (win-lose, lose-win, lose-lose, lose-neutral,...) we should not. In my culture this is called "pareto". The world would be worse if we all had the same goals.  


Notes on finding productivity
-----------------------------------

- I came up Jun's 3 rules for productivity way way back when I was an undergrad at Queen's. They are not universal. But even after all this time, they still ring true.
  
    1. Break before you're forced to. Break often and break well.
    2. As a corollary to the first, Push when you don't have to. Find projects that you *want* to push when you don't have to.
    3. And finally, Act as if nothing more is going to get done next week, next quarter, next year (what I now call "the Fallacy of Next Quarter").

- If you look at your agenda and you feel overwhelmed, subdivide your tasks into subtasks. If you're still overwhelmed, cut them up again. Repeat, until each task fits in half-hour chunk. Then start doing. When rock climbing, sometimes you look up from your current position, you see no holds, no path up. It is amazing how different the wall looks when you pull yourself up even by a few inches -- new holds and pathways are revealed.

- How much time should you spend making yourself faster, eg by automation? See `XKCD Productivity tip <https://xkcd.com/1205/>`_
