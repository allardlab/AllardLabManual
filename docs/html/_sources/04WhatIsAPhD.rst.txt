Three published or publishable papers, at least two of which are first-author, makes a PhD. Advancement is when you have a draft of the first paper, and the proposal and proof-of-concept for two more.

There are many equivalences (a high-impact paper probably counts for two; 3 middle-author papers probably count as a first-author paper; a widely-forked software..). Then, the onus is on the Candidate to argue this equivalence.

Different PhD programs have different standards.
Different co-advisors have different standards.

Advancement and defence
***********************

One of the most fruitful, energizing and empowering activities in science is getting a bunch of smart people in a room and talking about a research project with them.  
One of my favorite memories from recent years is one time when two senior faculty had a project they were excited about, and they got a few other faculty in a conference room to discuss their project idea.
Advancement to Candidacy is one of your opportunities to do this! It is both a time to get smart people's feedback. It is also stressful because it involves a tonne of work, and because it is a checkpoint to discuss challenges. Here are some tips.

Advancement tips
================

* Projects don't need to be related.

* Co-authored papers can be excerpted, provided you add a suitable Intro and Discussion, and a Statement of Co-authorship

* Common pitfall in Advancement presentation: Be clear to distinguish the state of the field and your contribution.

* Unlike for papers, the title doesn't need to actively contain the result.

* Executive summary is self-contained. See “Project summary” examples.

* For published/submitted papers, copy the tex source and dump it in your Advancement write-up. What was Supp Mat or Appendix can be part of main body.

* For unpublished projects, be sure to include
  
  - Target results
  - Preliminary results: at least one figure
  - How you hope the results address the specific question
  - Timeline

* Use bibtex and a modern bibliographic tool for References (Mendeley, ReadCube Papers, ...).

The prototypic timeline
=======================

- T-minus-6 weeks: First draft of write-up to Jun
  
- Once Jun approves draft:

  - Invitation sent to prospective Committee members
  - Scheduling

- T-minus 2 weeks: 

  - Write-up sent to Committee

  - Presentation draft sit-down with Jun

- T-minus 1 weeks: Presentation practice with group

- Weekend or evening before: Final run-through with Jun

- T-minus 0: Advance!

Quarter reports
***************

It's easy to get lost in details and short-term milestones, forgetting about the big picture, so we put this in place to force ourselves out of the "urgent-vs-important" trap.
The quarter report is an opportunity to think about the big picture.
This is a short summary of what you've done and are planning to do.
It can be as short as 7 sentences, but can be longer.

1. This quarter I planned to...
2. I generated the following results...
3. The main challenges were/are...
4. I presented my work by/at… (paper submissions, conferences, ...)
5. In addition to my research, this quarter I (took classes, organized a seminar series, TAed, mentored undergraduate or rotation student...)
6. Next quarter, I plan to...
7. (If <100%) My percent-effort on these projects was... [This is so we can both keep track of time off for personal reasons, projects with other PIs, classes etc. ]

Put your report in an editable format (Google Doc, latex, MS Word doc), and we will schedule a special slot to go through it together.

This exercise is valuable if it is used for more than a research update, that is, not to show and interrogate new results. (If you have new results that I haven't seen, then just put it under "6. Next quarter", for an easy win next quarter!)


Bonus topics you're welcome to include (in addition to anything else you want to):

1. For one of my current projects, of all the things that might happen, here is one cool thing, one weird thing, and one bad thing that we could discover:...
2. A skill or technique I want to learn and teach the group is...
3.  In the `own-learn-teach-delegate <https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2020/10/R2006F_PODOLNY_ROSNER-768x1189.png>`_ axes, here is something I want to delegate to Jun/someone else, and something I want to take ownership of:...
