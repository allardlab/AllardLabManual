Peer reviewing
--------------

Virtue: When we peer-review, we are constructive and we try to make their paper better.

For me (Jun), peer-reviewing is the scientist's version of a musician practicing scales. This is the action that makes me improve the most. It hones the skill of analyzing the technical approach, recognizing a gap, judging and improving rigor, and evaluating impact.

After a Nature `editorial <https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01533-8>`_ came out on the role of trainees in peer review, we adopt the "Bovyn rule": We always have a synchronous meeting to discuss the manuscript (not just asynchronous discussion).
