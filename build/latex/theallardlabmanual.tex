Virtue: When we peer\sphinxhyphen{}review, we are constructive and we try to make their paper better.

\sphinxAtStartPar
For me (Jun), peer\sphinxhyphen{}reviewing is the scientist’s version of a musician practicing scales. This is the action that makes me improve the most. It hones the skill of analyzing the technical approach, recognizing a gap, judging and improving rigor, and evaluating impact.

\sphinxAtStartPar
After a Nature \sphinxhref{https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01533-8}{editorial} came out on the role of trainees in peer review, we adopt the “Bovyn rule”: We always have a synchronous meeting to discuss the manuscript (not just asynchronous discussion).

\sphinxAtStartPar
The mission of our research group is to make \sphinxstyleemphasis{rigorous, relevant and elegant} contributions to the scientific knowledge of the world.
We use computational, mathematical and biophysical approaches to figure out \sphinxstyleemphasis{how living cells use force, space and time} in their \sphinxstyleemphasis{problem\sphinxhyphen{}solving strategies}.
We work so that the basic science discoveries we make become part of the \sphinxstyleemphasis{worldwide, multi\sphinxhyphen{}generational tapestry of scientific knowledge} that benefits all people.

\subsection{How I write papers}
\label{\detokenize{PaperWritingTips:how-i-write-papers}}\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Find some role\sphinxhyphen{}model papers, just to get inspiration for how to arrange figures, expose statements, organize subsections. Ideally the role\sphinxhyphen{}model paper is from a similar journal to the one we are targeting.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Outline the story: What are the Results headings and all the subfigures that tell this story? Sketch abstract.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Subfigures in Matlab .eps files

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Assemble figures, write captions. Nice meaty captions: A good paper can be followed by reading captions alone (without reading Main Text).

\end{enumerate}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Now relax. Lots of work ahead, but if you did 1\sphinxhyphen{}3 correctly, the rest is like a ball rolling down a hill.
\begin{enumerate}
\sphinxsetlistlabels{\arabic}{enumi}{enumii}{}{.}%

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Write Results text, Methods/Model text, Supplement. A good paper can be followed by reading Results text alone (without looking at figs).

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Big literature review, spend a few days, re\sphinxhyphen{}read \textasciitilde{}15 papers, search for anything we missed.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Write Discussion text. Connect to the field. Rank order paragraphs from most important to least important. Be upfront, but not apologetic, about limitations of work.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Write Intro text. The main purpose of Intro is to describe the gap in knowledge. Writing such a short overview of the field requires you to have an opinion of the field \textendash{} mark of scientific maturity.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Assemble, polish. Clean up references. Give to lots of people for feedback. Get ideas for suggested referees.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Draft cover letter to the handling editor

Omer’s 4 key questions to answer in a cover letter: (1) How will this work make others think differently and move the field forward? (2) How does our work relate to current literature? (3) Who is the most relevant audience for the work? (4) What has the work accomplished and what has it not achieved?

\end{itemize}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Now relax. Measured in “wall clock” time, you might be halfway. The next step requires a stomach: {\hyperref[\detokenize{OldEmails:receiving-reviews}]{\sphinxcrossref{\DUrole{std}{\DUrole{std-ref}{receiving peer review}}}}}.


\subsection{Jun’s Revision process}
\label{\detokenize{PaperWritingTips:jun-s-revision-process}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
My workflow for resubmissions is as follows. It’s kind of cumbersome but I find it works.
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
I give every Reviewer comment a code, like “Rev1Minor3”.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
I create THREE google docs in \sphinxhref{https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Fnvh7tMW2qKfAqGih7cZQu2FYQpl11KP}{a folder here}.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxhref{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJF-WhjId5Jq-zjtKajfnrgNW0tzaovpl3gdHIQdzQA/edit?usp=sharing}{A “Dashboard” doc}, with very short summary of each comment, so we can check them off as we go \textendash{} like a progress dashboard.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Another doc for the actual \sphinxhref{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ap\_7f1qu0ZUwOYDTvV-qGcEqiTH\_IX9LgTKLFlV54hU/edit?usp=sharing}{careful response letter}. This is mostly blank for now, but then can be made quickly following cut\sphinxhyphen{}and\sphinxhyphen{}paste from Big Notes, and then edited carefully, especially for tone, which is easy to get wrong.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Writing a paper is a continuum of fact\sphinxhyphen{}reporting (“we did this”, “we observed this”) to interpretation (“this suggests that…”, “this might have implications for…”). Caption is most factual, followed by Results text, followed by figure caption first sentence and Result headings. Discussion is most interpretation. For some historical reason, the figure caption’s first sentence is the interpretation, while the subfigure sentences are factual.

\section{Being an effective scientific communicator}
\label{\detokenize{02Elements:being-an-effective-scientific-communicator}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
We spend a lot of time on communication, optimizing presentations, poster, paper figures. This is for a few reasons.
\begin{enumerate}
\sphinxsetlistlabels{\arabic}{enumi}{enumii}{}{.}%
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Clear thinking means clear communicating, and clear communicating is clear thinking.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Science gains from network effects, but only if each lab/scientist devotes effort to communicating and coordinating. Like a high\sphinxhyphen{}performance computer devoting some of its cpu time to parallelization.

\section{The elements}
\label{\detokenize{02Elements:the-elements}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
There is a standard layout \textendash{} time\sphinxhyphen{}tested, powerful \textendash{} for a  scientific contribution that works particularly well.
\begin{itemize}

\section{Approach and gap are of equal importance}
\label{\detokenize{02Elements:approach-and-gap-are-of-equal-importance}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
“When I sit down with colleagues over a beer at a meeting, we don’t go over the facts, we don’t talk about what’s known; we talk about what we’d like to figure out, about what needs to be done… This crucial element in science was being left out for the students.” \sphinxhyphen{} Stuart Firestein (Columbia Neuroscience)

\sphinxAtStartPar
Doing science involves two activities of equal importance:
\begin{enumerate}
\sphinxsetlistlabels{\arabic}{enumi}{enumii}{(}{)}%
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Identifying the gap in current knowledge/needs

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Computational/modeling/experiment approach and carrying out that approach

\end{enumerate}

\noindent\sphinxincludegraphics[width=400\sphinxpxdimen]{{figGapApproach}.pdf}

\sphinxAtStartPar
It’s ok to have one before you have the other (exploratory projects, “approach first” projects, “question first” projects,…) and it almost always happens that the approach and gap change throughout a project.


\section{The importance+rigor+time trade\sphinxhyphen{}off}
\label{\detokenize{02Elements:the-importance-rigor-time-trade-off}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
A useful coordinate system to “project” (verb) success as a project progresses:

\noindent\sphinxincludegraphics[width=400\sphinxpxdimen]{{fig3way_2}.pdf}
\begin{enumerate}
\sphinxsetlistlabels{\arabic}{enumi}{enumii}{(}{)}%
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Importance/impact of the result: This importance criteria is often the easiest to retreat on, because there is an attitude in the scientific community that scientists are bad at predicting future importance anyway.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Rigor/completeness/quality. How much did we explore all the “nooks and crannies”, eg parameter sweeps? How much did we reject alternative possibilities? How much did we test the tools? Also in this category is the quality of presentation. How clear do the figures, text, code repositories, tables, communicate the result?

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Efficiency/use of resources/speed: Are we going to get this paper done in time, so people can move on to even bigger and brighter things!

\end{enumerate}

\sphinxAtStartPar
There is a fuzzy, probabilistic minimal threshold for each of these.

\sphinxAtStartPar
Above the threshold, there is a trade\sphinxhyphen{}off between them. Teams benefit from discussing this trade\sphinxhyphen{}off.

\sphinxAtStartPar
Don’t underestimate the value of speed.


\section{Jun’s definition of baseline scientific rigor}
\label{\detokenize{02Elements:jun-s-definition-of-baseline-scientific-rigor}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
Working in multidisciplinary teams has taught me that \sphinxstylestrong{rigor isn’t a rigid threshold—it’s a flexible, context\sphinxhyphen{}dependent standard} that adapts to the nature of the question, the tools available, and the intended audience.

\sphinxAtStartPar
So, I have adopted this definition: baseline rigor means \sphinxstylestrong{accurate, transparent reporting of what was done, what was not done, and what remains uncertain.}
Think of it like a \sphinxstylestrong{battlefield journalist in a conflict zone} rather than a battlefield general:
A journalist’s job is not to win or advance the troops but to report faithfully on its unfolding realities—regardless of whether the war is ongoing, paused, or complete. Similarly, a scientific paper is a snapshot of a project in time: a rigorous paper doesn’t need every question answered or every experiment performed, but it must report an accurate, clear story about the current state of understanding.
Speculation is ok, wishful thinking is ok, as long as it is labeled as such.

\sphinxAtStartPar
The \sphinxstyleemphasis{science} does not need to be complete, but the \sphinxstyleemphasis{report} needs to be complete.

\sphinxAtStartPar
Using this definition for baseline rigor, this immediately implies a relationship with importance of the result, since by this definition alone, we would publish unimportant/boring/trivial results.
So rigor can be paired with, but separated from, the concept of \sphinxstylestrong{importance.}
Baseline rigor ensures a scientific report is trustworthy, but importance ensures it’s worth sharing in the first place.
A perfectly rigorous but trivial observation adds little to the broader scientific tapestry.
Therefore, we aim to meet baseline rigor as a non\sphinxhyphen{}negotiable standard \sphinxstyleemphasis{while actively engaging with the question of importance.}
This interplay creates a healthy tension: we strive to report honestly, avoid unnecessary scope creep, and ensure that what we publish contributes meaningfully to advancing knowledge.
Balancing these two dimensions is the art—and the joy—of scientific work.

\sphinxAtStartPar
That is, rigor primarily lives in how we report and contextualize our work, not in reaching some mythical state of experimental completeness.
This perspective frees us to tackle ambitious, cross\sphinxhyphen{}disciplinary questions while maintaining high standards.
When we’re uncertain about a result or interpretation, we don’t need to do “just one more experiment” \textendash{} instead, we can rigorously describe our current understanding and its boundaries.
This approach helps prevent the common trap of endless perfectionism while ensuring our work contributes reliably to the scientific record.


\section{A pipeline process requiring different skills and mindsets}
\label{\detokenize{02Elements:a-pipeline-process-requiring-different-skills-and-mindsets}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
Scientific research projects are a pipeline process with many steps.
Each step in the process requires a different skillset and a different mindset.
(Not “smart”, “hardworking”, “fast”, which are useful at all steps.)
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Early, exploratory phase. Skillset and mindset: Ability to accept uncertainty. Curiosity. Ok with lack of rigor. Willingness to try messy, vague things. Let’s just see what happens! “Intentionality” is bad here. A love of learning. Being comfortable with lots of failure.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Rigor phase, “benchwork” phase. Skillset and mindset: Technical rigor. Carefulness. Being well\sphinxhyphen{}tempered. At some point here, there must be a transition from “what is the most interesting conclusion” to “how would we show that conclusion?”.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Production phase. Intentionality. Being focused on a single goal, which is to get this thing out the door. Willingness to put aside ideals of ambition. Willingness to put aside ideals of comprehensiveness. Perfectionism is the enemy.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Write\sphinxhyphen{}up phase and  review phase. Skillset and mindset: (1) Empathy, humility. Put yourself in someone else’s shoes (the peer reviewer, the field, the collaborators,…). To be a “stranger in a familiar land”. Ability to listen to others, and hear both their logical argument and what they aren’t saying. (2) Since the goal is communication rather than impact, some tradeoffs swap completely. Perfectionism in presentation and clarity, at the expense of perfectionism in eg comprehensiveness and completeness. The \sphinxstyleemphasis{science} does not need to be complete, but the \sphinxstyleemphasis{report} needs to be complete.

\end{itemize}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Pipeline steps are “multiplicative” rather than “additive”, meaning that you cannot make up for a deficit in one with being a superstar in another.
In a way, the fact that they’re multiplicative is anxiety\sphinxhyphen{}inducing, because you must be good at everything.
But in another way, it is liberating: You don’t need to be the smartest, the most careful, the hardest working. (Indeed often, you will see people that seem 10x smarter than you, and they can’t get anything done.)


\section{Figures!}
\label{\detokenize{02Elements:figures}}\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
What makes a great figure? \sphinxcode{\sphinxupquote{Slides about figures}}.

\end{itemize}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Upshot: You need the ability to make a figure that is publication grade, informative, and digestible. \sphinxstyleemphasis{Not a pixel out of place.}

\sphinxAtStartPar
The “Masterful Inaction” principle: it’s ok to make a quick rough figure, as long as you’re doing it because you have the ability to make a publication\sphinxhyphen{}quality figure and have deliberately made the decision not to.

\sphinxAtStartPar
For size rules, check out guidelines for some or our favorite journals:
\sphinxhref{https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/figures}{PLoS},

\sphinxhref{https://www.embopress.org/page/journal/14602075/authorguide\#figureformat}{EMBO}.
Roughly, the figures are either 19cm or 8.5cm wide, tall enough to fit on a single 8.5”\sphinxhyphen{}11” page with their beefy caption, and fonts must be larger than 6pt.


\section{The under\sphinxhyphen{}rated power of writing}
\label{\detokenize{02Elements:the-under-rated-power-of-writing}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
The paper \sphinxhyphen{} meaning a 4\sphinxhyphen{}10 page document, written in full sentences, describing a gap in knowledge, a method, a result, and its impact \sphinxhyphen{} is a highly\sphinxhyphen{}rated and yet still under\sphinxhyphen{}rated mode of communication. Nothing compares.
\begin{itemize}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Start the latex doc early! Prototype latex doc that Jun uses personally in \sphinxhref{https://github.com/allardjun/JunsLatexRepository}{this git repo}. (This is good for Project Seeds, and papers. Probably not good for thesis.)

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
A lot of writing will get thrown away as the project evolves. \sphinxstylestrong{Writing is never wasted, because clear writing is clear thinking.}

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
“When people present an idea in slides, everyone says ‘yaaa that’s greaaaat’. But when you make them write it down in a 1\sphinxhyphen{}page proposal, suddenly the problems become clear, and the needed improvement becomes clear.” \sphinxhyphen{} Qing Nie, paraphrased by Jun.  In many cases in our projects, we have a fantastic presentation (poster or slide deck) about a year before we have a great paper.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
“The reason writing a good 4 page memo is harder than ‘writing’ a 20 page powerpoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what’s more important than what, and how things are related.”” Jeff Bezos, quoted in \sphinxhref{https://reproof.app/blog/document-first-then-build}{“Write documentation first, then build”}. Similar point made by economist and philanthropist Tyler Cowan in “\sphinxhref{https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/08/against-slide-decks.html}{Against slide decks}” (I’m not against slide decks though.)

\section{Getting to scientific quality / rigor}
\label{\detokenize{02Elements:getting-to-scientific-quality-rigor}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
Overflowing work hours (all\sphinxhyphen{}nighters etc) are avoidable.
It often feels like there is a crisis, and there is a sudden need to push to make it.
This phenomenon is sometimes called “heroics” %
\begin{footnote}[1]\sphinxAtStartFootnote
Some organizations believe that “heroics” are bad: they show the system failed. Then again, they are also a sign of optimism, aspiration: Many creators say they wouldn’t have been able to achieve greatness if they knew how hard it would be when they started. Sometimes there is an opportunity you want to pursue, but we don’t have 10 weeks. The important thing is that you know what you’re getting into.
%
\end{footnote} .
The way to avoid heroics begins 10 weeks before a deadline (conference poster or talk, advancement exam, grant submission, paper submission).
.. After that, the ball is rolling down a slope.

\sphinxAtStartPar
The time it takes for each step get shorter with (1) experience and (2) trust with the collaborators and with me.

\sphinxAtStartPar
Note many steps involve feedback to previous steps (e.g., in oral part you often realize you need a figure modification).
.. So, in true {\hyperref[\detokenize{03CodersAtWork:codersatwork}]{\sphinxcrossref{\DUrole{std}{\DUrole{std-ref}{DevOps}}}}} philosophy, you should plan to revisit every step.
.. We have a rigorous imposed timeline when getting ready to present a result to the outside world.
.. The time it takes for each step get shorter with experience and trust with the collaborators and with me.
In general during a science project, I try to serve as an advisor rather than a gatekeeper, but in terms of communicating and exposing it to the world, here I invoke my prerogative to be more controlling, at least at first.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
3\&4: Presentation \sphinxstylestrong{run\sphinxhyphen{}through with Jun}. No time\sphinxhyphen{}trial. See if everything hangs together. For talks: what slides are needed, how should they be designed? For posters: What’s the layout?

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
1: Final time\sphinxhyphen{}trial practice 1\sphinxhyphen{}on\sphinxhyphen{}1.  For posters, final version to printer. Focus on oral (spoken words); when you’re done the slides, you’re half done, because the spoken words are half the experience.

\end{itemize}

\sphinxAtStartPar
It’s a slog. Cycling through these steps get faster, and more independent. But the steps never go away.
People embarking on their first forays into research take about 1 week per step. (“Are you kidding me, 9 weeks to make a damned poster/talk?!”)
A question for you to be always asking yourself: How do you get faster and more independent, as you mature scientifically?
When going through this for the first time, I insist on a number of weeks for each step.
As you become more experience and I get over my trust issues, the steps accelerate \textendash{}in some cases a lot! (this acceleration is an honor for me to watch, and one of the single biggest joys in my professional life) \textendash{} but they sorta never go away.

\section{Advancement and defence}
\label{\detokenize{04WhatIsAPhD:advancement-and-defence}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
One of the most fruitful, energizing and empowering activities in science is getting a bunch of smart people in a room and talking about a research project with them.
One of my favorite memories from recent years is one time when two senior faculty had a project they were excited about, and they got a few other faculty in a conference room to discuss their project idea.
Advancement to Candidacy is one of your opportunities to do this! It is both a time to get smart people’s feedback. It is also stressful because it involves a tonne of work, and because it is a checkpoint to discuss challenges. Here are some tips.

\sphinxAtStartPar
All of our local lab machines (iMacs, Linux boxes) should have a standardized administrative account and standardized password. All of you should not use this for any actual work. Instead, you each have a user account on your primary machine. Sometimes we ask each other for access to each other’s primary machines, for access to files or computing power. If so, make your own account.

\sphinxAtStartPar
Our rough guideline is that, if you are using \sphinxstyleemphasis{\textgreater{}1000 core\sphinxhyphen{}hour equivalents / week}, we need to make a {[}budget, e.g., using Google Sheet \sphinxhref{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ak1teehkJODr\_7bZb\_bpxsQ6VofofcTX6nA1pTwIEq0/edit\#gid=1695749378}{example}.

Within\sphinxhyphen{}team wisdom\sphinxhyphen{}sharing has been the single biggest superpower of the Allard Lab. It leads to exponential improvement, like compound interest. How do we maintain that in an asynchronous world? A remote world? My worst concern is that the advantages of asynchronous Work From Home are \sphinxstyleemphasis{multiplicative}, while the advantages of synchronous, in\sphinxhyphen{}person work are \sphinxstyleemphasis{exponential} (because they compound).

\subsection{How to schedule a meeting}
\label{\detokenize{OldEmails:how-to-schedule-a-meeting}}\label{\detokenize{OldEmails:scheduling}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
One of the most empowering things about being in our big, active community is that we can exploit the expertise of those around us.
But one of the most frustrating and limiting tasks is scheduling a synchronous activity with a group.
Here are some tips.

\sphinxAtStartPar
Always:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
When you send out a poll of time, always specify a reply\sphinxhyphen{}by date, and say explicitly that it is to “protect the calendars” or “protect your schedules” of the respondents.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
If you need 5 members, don’t pick 5 and then find a time. Make a ranked list of around 10, and start at the top. Try to find a committee that fits into the time interval. This is much easier than setting a committee then finding a time.

\end{itemize}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Sometimes:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Do it in two stages: First to pick day, and a second to pick the time (this reduces, e.g., 5 times in 5 days =25 options to 10 options)

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Offer them to tell you their availability by e\sphinxhyphen{}mail, and you put it into the platform.

\end{itemize}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Rarely, but when possible:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Wait until someone asks you a favor. Then, in the same e\sphinxhyphen{}mail when you respond to their request, remind them about your request.

\end{itemize}

\sphinxAtStartPar
Technology exists to help, but none of it is perfect: doodle, when2meet, Qualtrics (UCI gets it free), or a google form (most flexible).


\subsection{An old e\sphinxhyphen{}mail about receiving peer reviews}
\label{\detokenize{OldEmails:an-old-e-mail-about-receiving-peer-reviews}}\label{\detokenize{OldEmails:receiving-reviews}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
“…it is possible we get our referee reports back …

\sphinxAtStartPar
Even when the reviews are good, they are often worded in a way that sounds harsh. It is difficult to tell whether we should resubmit and rebut, or move to another journal, without careful thinking.

\sphinxAtStartPar
My rule is that, when I get review reports, I read them fully, then I set them aside for 24 hours for my emotions to cool before I think about next steps.

\sphinxAtStartPar
\sphinxhref{https://www.sciencealert.com/these-8-papers-were-rejected-before-going-on-to-win-the-nobel-prize}{The history of scientific progress} is contained in all the papers that were, at first, rejected.

\subsection{An old e\sphinxhyphen{}mail about accepting a conference invitation}
\label{\detokenize{OldEmails:an-old-e-mail-about-accepting-a-conference-invitation}}
\sphinxAtStartPar
“Many times, I’ve made decisions to spend time with family and friends rather than scientific opportunities, and I have never ever regretted it. A few times, I’ve tried to juggle too many things simultaneously, and then I’ve sometimes regretted it \textendash{} feeling like I gave both family \& science my “leftovers”. I have also had events where the most valuable thing was simply showing up, to show support for family or friends, e.g., to give one specific hug, and it didn’t matter whether it lasted 1 minute or 3 days. If it were me making this decision, I would think of it as speaking at the conference and giving my family my leftovers (which might be enough) versus going to the family event, and giving the conference my leftovers (in which case we can’t commit to speaking).”

How long should you stay stuck on something, trying to figure it out for yourself, before coming for help? About one week.

The best way to reach me is e\sphinxhyphen{}mail.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Under normal operations, the turnaround time for e\sphinxhyphen{}mails is within 24hrs of “business time” (e.g. weekdays). For logistics (scheduling meetings with a collaborator, we’re at a conference, we’re hosting a visitor), my expectation is slightly faster or much faster. When you are on vacation, or weekends or planned time\sphinxhyphen{}off, it is much slower.

\sphinxstylestrong{It is more important for me to know when you’re on reduced effort than that your effort be maximal.}

I take working with collaborators seriously.  By far the most impactful stuff we do is collaborative, but collaboration means it’s not just about you. I take my role here seriously and expect you to as well. Working on a project with another lead (e.g., grad student or postdoc) changes everything, pressure is on. I take this seriously and you will also be expected to.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Time is the single most important resource, both materially and symbolically. Not wasting other people’s time means showing up on\sphinxhyphen{}time to meetings and not going over in a formal time allotment.

I struggle with this bias: A few times in my past, a project failed that I invested my whole heart. Correctly or incorrectly, I subconsiously attribute these past failures to \sphinxstylestrong{running out of time} (before trainees or lead researchers left or had to prioritize other objectives, …), and over\sphinxhyphen{}investment in going for something more important or complete. This has led me to a bias towards forward momention, “quick and dirty” and “above threshold” planning. Deadlines (conference abstracts, manuscript submissions, grant timelines) feel to me like lifelines—opportunities to crystallize our work before it slips away into the fog of unfinished ideas. Sometimes, this means I might push for speed at the expense of chasing every fascinating side question, every extra control, or every ounce of scientific wonder. If you ever feel this pressure is undercutting the joy or depth of the work, flag it for me. I’d much rather recalibrate than lose sight of what makes science meaningful. \sphinxstylestrong{The downside is that it means *you* might need to be the one to keep your eye on the clock.}

I came up Jun’s 3 rules for productivity way way back when I was an undergrad at Queen’s. They are not universal. But even after all this time, they still ring true.
\begin{enumerate}
\sphinxsetlistlabels{\arabic}{enumi}{enumii}{}{.}%
\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
Break before you’re forced to. Break often and break well.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
As a corollary to the first, Push when you don’t have to. Find projects that you \sphinxstyleemphasis{want} to push when you don’t have to.

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
And finally, Act as if nothing more is going to get done next week, next quarter, next year (what I now call “the Fallacy of Next Quarter”).

\end{enumerate}

\item {} 
\sphinxAtStartPar
If you look at your agenda and you feel overwhelmed, subdivide your tasks into subtasks. If you’re still overwhelmed, cut them up again. Repeat, until each task fits in half\sphinxhyphen{}hour chunk. Then start doing. When rock climbing, sometimes you look up from your current position, you see no holds, no path up. It is amazing how different the wall looks when you pull yourself up even by a few inches \textendash{} new holds and pathways are revealed.
