The mission of our research group
---------------------------------

The mission of our research group is to make *rigorous, relevant and elegant* contributions to the scientific knowledge of humanity.
We use computational, mathematical and biophysical approaches to figure out *how living cells use force, space and time* in their *problem-solving strategies*.
We work so that the basic science discoveries we make become part of the *worldwide, multi-generational tapestry of scientific knowledge* that benefits all people.  

----

It may sound rote, but every part of this 3-sentence paragraph has operational meaning.

- rigorous 
- relevant: addresses a gaps in knowledge
- force, space and time: physics, mechanics, stat mech (entropy, diffusion)
- cellular problem solving strategies
- worldwide, multi-generational tapestry of scientific knowledge
  
..
  <!--: awareness of limitations; due diligence; maximizing the interpretation without "over-interpreting your data" (one of the worst insults to a scientist!)--> 

.. 
  <!--: communication. Faith in the role of basic science discovery in transforming society, and the ability to establish possible connections-->

  ## The mission and you

  You are here because there is overlap between your goals and our mission.

  ![Example timeline](figOverlap.svg)


  <!--No one should ever question your goals. And you should never de-legitimize someone else's goals (provided those goals don't violate someone else's belongings).-->
  <!--It is essential to your membership in this group that you never delegitimize someone else's goals, provided those goals don't harm the belongings of others.-->
  <!--
  We all have different goals, and we embrace and exploit that heterogeneity.
  The thing I am proudest of in all my time at UCI -- in the singular, non-rhetorical sense --  is that the first 4 PhDs from this Group pursued the most different life paths that I can think of.


  ### If you are not in the overlap:

  People often appreciate that their lives change over time, but less that their goals also change. Which is good too!  Almost always, there is still overlap (middle diagram).
  If you conclude there exists no overlap -- *which is not bad! There are so many legitimate, worthy missions in any program, in science, in the world,...*
  then let's have a win-win conversation about how to move forward. I will never judge you for that.

Value-virtue pairs
------------------

To achieve our mission, we adopt certain principles, or "virtues". Every virtue comes from a value.


- Value: We try to make other people's science better.
    - Virtue: Peer Reviewing See this :ref:`Peer reviewing <peer-reviewing>` section.
    - Virtue: We *memorialize* our own stuff, both for internal future use and possible external future use. See Dev Ops section
- Value: We value time, the most scarce and precious resource.
   - Virtue: Being on-time.
   
   .. - Jun's Rule If Jun is late, Jun agrees to put $1/min/attendee into an Allard Lab discretionary fund. 
- Value: We make other people want to work with us.
    - Virtue: Being a good listener, being excessively respectful of others. There are essential policies that have to do with respecting our colleagues, led by the wider scientific community, the UCI community, and our other affiliated communities. Besides meeting those standards, we try to go beyond them.
- Value: We think our projects are cool, in addition to useful.
  - *[Jun Question for Team] Should we start posting fun visuals, etc., on social media: BlueSky LinkedIn, other?.*
